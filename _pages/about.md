Hi! I am Mark, a scientific researcher working at the Friedrich-Alexander-University of Erlangen-Nürnberg in the department of Hardware-Software-Co-Design. I am also affiliated with the Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits IIS in Nürnberg where I am a researcher in the group "Effient-AI".

My work focuses on the efficient design of deep neural networks (DNNs) for use on embedded systems, mainly Cortex-M microcontroller units (MCUs). This research area is also referred to as "TinyML" or "Edge AI". Since MCUs are generally resource-constrained, while most DNNs are quite resource-intensive, my main research interest is to optimize the trade-off between a DNN's resource requirements and the AI performance it can achieve. As a result, I have focused heavily on hardware-aware neural architecture search, DNN compression, quantization techniques, and MCU-specific optimizations such as layer fusing or instruction set extensions.

My background and history
===

I received both my M.Sc. and B.Sc. in Computer Science from the Friedrich-Alexander-University of Erlangen-Nürnberg. During my studies I worked for almost five years as a working student at Siemens Mindsphere and then as a student assistant at Fraunhofer IIS, first in the group *Self-Learning Systems* and later in the group *Machine Learning & Validation*, where I also wrote my master thesis on *Energy Efficient Deployment of Deep Learning Applications on Restricted Hardware using Deep Compression*. After finishing my studies, I joined the Hardware-Software-Co-Design department at FAU as a research assistant and PhD student.
