title: "Dynamic Execution of CNNs on a Cortex-M7 MCU using BLE"
excerpt: "In this demonstration, we show how two CNNs trained on different tasks can be sent via BLE to a Nicla Vision MCU (Cortex-M7) and then executed on the device. This can be done without flashing or resetting the MCU at runtime by dynamically reconfiguring the CNN running on the MCU based on the information received via BLE. Both the topography of the CNN and its weights can be adjusted this way within in the resource constraints of the MCU."
