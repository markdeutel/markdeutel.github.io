This poster shows how fully quantized DNNs deployed on Cortex-M microcontroller units (MCUs) can be either fine-tuned or even retrained from scratch. DNN training on MCUs poses additional challenges due to the tight resource constraints of such systems, and this poster discusses a methodology to overcome them.
